[Calculator Project](JavaScript%20Projects)

### To-Do App
This is a basic application which accepts user input, and then saves and stores that input to be viewed later. The user can input tasks that they need to do, forming a list of items. They can then remove items from the list once done with the task.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is simply a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The player always goes first, and then the computer takes its turn. It includes sounds for placing down X's and O's as well as for the game concluding.

### Pizza Menu Project
This project is an example webpage for ordering a pizza from a company. It includes the options to select the size of the pizza, as well as add as many toppings as the user desires. The price is dynamically updated to reflect the size and toppings once the user places their order.

### Calculator
This is a basic 4 function calculator. Users can do the expected functions of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numbers.
